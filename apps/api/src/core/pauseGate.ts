/**
 * Cooperative pause/resume.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT an AbortSignal. Aborting is cancellation — it unwinds the
 * run and it cannot be undone. Pausing has to leave everything exactly where it
 * is so that resuming continues the same run, so the only thing that can
 * implement it is the run itself choosing to wait.
 *
 * So this is a latch the orchestrator checks at every safe point (step
 * boundaries and outer-loop turns). Pausing mid-flight inside a provider call
 * is intentionally impossible: the remote side has already been asked to do the
 * work, and a "pause" that let a half-finished external call land would be a
 * lie. The observable effect is that pausing takes effect at the next boundary.
 *
 * Latches live in memory, like approval waiters, and for the same reason: a
 * paused run is meaningless once the process holding it is gone.
