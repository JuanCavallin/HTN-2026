/**
 * The Jev browser decision — ONE evaluation request per browser step.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WE REACH JEV THROUGH THE VERCEL AI GATEWAY. There is exactly one route, and
 * this is it:
 *
 *     createGateway({ apiKey: AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY })
 *       .evaluationModel('typesafe-ai/jev')
 *     -> experimental_evaluate({ model, state, questions })
 *
 * NOT `@typesafe-ai/sdk`, and NOT the OpenAI-compatible chat-completions
 * endpoint. Person 2's `providers/jev/live.ts` established this route; this
 * file is the browser's caller on the same road, and it deliberately reuses
 * Person 2's `config.providers.jev` credential slot rather than inventing a
 * second one.
 *
 * WHAT JEV IS: a decision model. It answers TYPED QUESTIONS AGAINST STATE and
 * returns a choice or a probability, each with a distribution. It cannot
 * generate text. There is no prompt in this file and there must never be one —
 * `criteria` is the interface.
 *
 * SPECULATIVE FAN-OUT, the whole trick:
 *
 *     one request ─┬─ operation         CLICK | TYPE_TEXT | SELECT | SCROLL...
 *                  ├─ click_target      choice over click-eligible indices
 *                  ├─ type_text_target  choice over editable indices
 *                  └─ select_target     choice over dropdown indices
 *
 * We ask for the operation AND every target it might need, then discard the
 * heads that do not match the chosen operation. Two decisions, one round trip.
 * Person 2's `route()` uses the same shape — privacy + intelligence + one
 * boolean per tool, all batched — so this is the house pattern, not a local
 * invention.
 *
 * The trade is deliberate and NOT free: you pay for the discarded heads. It is
 * right here because latency on stage is worth more than fractions of a cent.
 * Narrow `allowedOperations` if a run ever needs the cost back.
 *
 * TIMEOUT: a browser step is interactive. `BROWSER_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS`
 * (2000ms) bounds the call via an AbortSignal, and on timeout the caller's
 * deterministic fallback takes the step rather than stalling the demo.
 * ============================================================================
