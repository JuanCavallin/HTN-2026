/**
 * WHO runs a node, as opposed to WHAT KIND of work it is.
 *
 * `GraphNodeType` answers "what kind of work" — fetch, judge, redact. That is
 * the right axis for the interpreter and the wrong one for the canvas. To make
 * an agentic process legible you have to show, at a glance, which box is our
 * own deterministic code, which is a real external tool, which is a cheap
 * model call, and which is an opaque agent loop we cannot see inside.
 *
 * That is this file. The executor is DERIVED from the node type, never stored,
 * so it cannot drift from the schema. It lives in @htn/shared because the API
 * (step labelling, telemetry grouping) and the web app (colour, icon, border)
 * must agree on exactly one mapping.
 *
 * The palette is not invented here — it matches the classDefs already used in
 * docs/example_flow.md, which the team agreed on before any of this existed.
