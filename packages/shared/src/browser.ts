/**
 * The browser family's shared vocabulary — `3B-4`'s contract.
 *
 * THE CENTRAL IDEA: a page becomes a small NUMBERED TABLE of interactive
 * elements. Jev is asked which INDEX to act on and answers `7`. The live
 * element handle for index 7 never leaves the adapter, and no CSS selector is
 * ever generated, returned, or stored.
 *
 * Why that matters beyond tidiness:
 *   - Selectors go stale between the snapshot and the click; handles do not.
 *   - An accessibility snapshot is 2-5KB where a screenshot is 100KB+, and
 *     vision tokens cost 3-5x text tokens. The table IS the request state, and
 *     state dominates a batched System One request, so keeping it small is the
 *     single biggest latency lever we control.
 *   - A model that can only return an integer into a list WE built cannot be
 *     talked by page content into issuing an action. That constrains prompt
 *     injection structurally. It does NOT replace `authorize_action`.
 *
 * ADDITIVE EDITS ONLY — published API.

 * browserbase/live.ts), and the node that opens a session is frequently not
 * the node you want to watch. An `agent_task` opens one deep inside a harness
 * loop; a `dispatch` opens one via whichever tool it chose. Hanging the URL off
 * `browser.open`'s step output would mean the panel works for exactly one graph
 * shape and silently shows nothing for the rest.
 *
 * So the session is announced on the event stream (`browser.session.opened`)
 * and the UI keeps its own list. `nodeId` is best-effort attribution for the
 * canvas; a session with none still shows up, it just isn't pinned to a node.
 *
 * NOTHING SENSITIVE BELONGS HERE. This record crosses SSE to the browser and is
 * persisted in the run's event log. It carries a URL to a viewer and no page
 * content — never put form values, cookies or credentials on it.
