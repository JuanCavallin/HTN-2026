/**
 * Input schema for the two baseline playbooks — the comparison points a graph
 * run is measured against:
 *
 *   baseline        B0: one frontier-tier LLM call, no tools, no graph,
 *                   no redaction gate.
 *   baseline_agent  B1: one agent on a frontier route with EVERY eligible
 *                   tool exposed and no Jev routing — the "frontier model,
 *                   all tools" baseline the design spec's evaluation names.
 *
 * Both are handed THE SAME TASK the graph was built for: the server resolves
 * the graph's prompt (the chat request that produced it, plus the run's
 * variables and any source text the graph carries) and snapshots it here at
 * creation, the same way a graph run snapshots its graph. Without that the
 * baseline answered a different, much smaller question and every comparison
 * was meaningless.
